# De-Code v1
This was my first project for cryptography, where I developed my own algorithm and, performed encryption and decryption over plain text so as to test it's integrity.

It is all simple... 
* The default PIN is "1238"
* You can customise it to your will and have fun.

All you have to do is run this program and it will create a file called "ciphered.txt".
You can send this file to your friend, where he/she will have this "software" waiting for it.
All your friend has to do is to paste the file in the same directory as the "software", and run it...

Enjoy!

PS. I created this program for Windows as it has some includes that may not work on Linux and/or Mac. But have fun changing them all you want.
